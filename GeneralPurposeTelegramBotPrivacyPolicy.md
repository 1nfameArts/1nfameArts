# Privacy Policy for my bots
I store nothing about you on my servers. No data is collected besides what's needed for the bot to function (in this case, input). User inputs will not be read. Your Telegram UserID isn't stored (Exceptions can apply), so is your ChatID (Exceptions can apply). 

# Exceptions
Data is typically temporarily stored until bot reboot. Bot reboots are unannounced.
List of affected bots:
* None yet :)
**The following bots will remember across sessions:**
* Luckily I'm not that serious, yet.
